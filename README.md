## How to Play 🤔❓
- Use the left and right arrow keys or 'A' and 'D' keys to steer your sphere left or right, changing lanes to avoid obstacles.
- Press 'J', 'K', and 'L' keys to switch between different colored forms (red, green, and blue) respectively, once you have at least 5 energy points for the desired power-up.
- Activate your current form's power by pressing the space bar. Pressing the space bar multiple times during the activation of the power-up has no effect.
- Pause and resume the game by pressing the 'Escape' key.
  
## Power-ups 💪
- Red Power (Nuke): Eliminate all existing obstacles ahead of you with a powerful explosion.
- Green Power (Multiplier): Boost your score and energy points for the next collected orb, giving you a significant advantage.
- Blue Power (Shield): Surround yourself with a protective shield that absorbs one obstacle hit, keeping you safe from harm.

## Be careful! 🟫
- You will revert back to normal form upon hitting an obstacle in coloured form.
- No worries, you won't be damaged multiple times by the same obstacle.
- You die (in the game) upon hitting an obstacle when in normal form.
